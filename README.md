# Banco-de-Portugal-Predicting-Term-Deposit-Subscription

ABSTRACT

This project aims to develop a predictive model to enhance the marketing 
efforts of Banco de Portugal by determining whether clients will subscribe 
to a term deposit based on historical campaign data. Banks often face 
challenges in engaging clients effectively, managing vast amounts of data, 
and predicting client behavior, making predictive accuracy crucial for 
successful marketing campaigns. Using a dataset of 45,211 instances and 16 
features related to client demographics, campaign details, and previous 
campaign outcomes, this project involves comprehensive data exploration, 
feature engineering, and model development. The primary objective is to 
build a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict a 
binary outcome—whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. 
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score, and the results will be documented to provide 
insights for optimizing future marketing campaigns at Banco de Portugal. 
The exclusion of the "duration" feature ensures that the model can make 
realistic predictions based on information available before the final contact 
with clients.

INTRODUCTION

In today's competitive financial landscape, banks constantly seek ways to 
improve their marketing strategies to attract and retain customers. One 
common approach is the use of direct marketing campaigns to promote 
financial products, such as term deposits. Banco de Portugal, like many other 
banks, relies on phone-based campaigns to encourage clients to subscribe to 
these products. However, predicting whether a client will respond 
positively to such a campaign presents several challenges, including 
effective client engagement, data management, and ensuring predictive 
accuracy. 
This project focuses on analyzing historical marketing campaign data from 
Banco de Portugal to build a machine learning model capable of predicting 
whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. By leveraging data on client 
demographics, campaign contact details, and outcomes from previous 
campaigns, the aim is to develop a classification model that provides 
valuable insights into customer behavior. This predictive model can help 
Banco de Portugal target the right clients more effectively, thereby 
optimizing its marketing efforts and improving campaign success rates. 
The project involves several key tasks: data exploration, feature engineering, 
model development, and performance evaluation. By the end of the project, 
a well-documented predictive model will be built to support Banco de 
Portugal’s future marketing campaigns, ensuring better client targeting and 
higher return on investment. 

ABOUT BANCO DE PORTUGAL

The Banco de Portugal (English: Bank of Portugal) is the Portuguese member 
of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Portugal from 
1846 to 1998, issuing the Portuguese escudo. Since 2014, it has also been 
Portugal's national competent authority within European Banking 
Supervision. The bank was founded by royal charter in 1846, during the 
reign of Queen Maria II of Portugal, by a merger of the Banco de Lisboa, 
the first bank founded in Portugal, and insurer Companhia Confiança 
Nacional. 

OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model 
that accurately predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit 
based on historical data from Banco de Portugal’s direct marketing 
campaigns. By analyzing client demographics, campaign contact details, and 
previous campaign outcomes, the project aims to: 
1. Explore the dataset to identify patterns and relationships between the 
features and the target variable. 
2. Engineer features that improve the predictive power of the model, 
while excluding unrealistic predictors such as contact duration. 
3. Build and evaluate classification models using machine learning 
techniques to predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term 
deposit. 
4. Optimize the model’s performance by evaluating it with metrics such 
as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
5. Provide actionable insights that can help Banco de Portugal enhance 
their marketing strategies by targeting clients more effectively and 
improving campaign outcomes. 
The ultimate goal is to support the bank in making data-driven decisions to 
improve the efficiency and success of future marketing efforts.
